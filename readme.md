# CHIP-8 Emulator

A simple Chip-8 emulator with a 3D voxel rendering mode and a filter to clear the intrinsic screen flickering. It comes with the most popular games, and you can add more under the __roms__ folder.

## Building

This project uses [Premake](https://premake.github.io/) to build project files. As for now, I have only compiled it under windows, but there shouldn't be any problems compiling for other platforms like Linux or MacOS.
